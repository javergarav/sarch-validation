# Graph-driven Security Assurance in Web Software Architectures ‚Äì Dataset

This repository contains the dataset used to validate the thesis **"Graph-driven Security Assurance in Web Software Architectures."**  

The goal is to provide a structured collection of **software architectures** that serve as study objects for:  

- Identifying architectural weaknesses  
- Detecting security vulnerabilities  
- Redesigning architectures with countermeasures  

All of these activities are performed at the **security level**.  

---

## Dataset Structure  

The dataset is organized into **three groups of architectures**.  
Each group is represented by a folder (`group_1`, `group_2`, `group_3`).  

Inside each group, every system is documented in a dedicated `.sarch` file, which describes its architecture using the **SARCH language**.
