# Metrics

## 1. Authentication Architecture

**Metric: Secure Authentication Mechanism Ratio (SAMR)**

Measures the proportion of authentication mechanisms that comply with secure design principles.

SAMR(A) = N_SecureAuth(A) / N_Auth(A)

- N_SecureAuth(A): Number of authentication mechanisms that comply with secure standards.

EACR(A) = N_EffectiveAC(A) / N_AC(A)

- N_EffectiveAC(A): Number of properly implemented access control mechanisms.
- N_AC(A): Total number of access control mechanisms.

Rule: EACR(A) >= tau_EACR

## 3. Input and Output Architecture

**Metric: Input Validation Coverage Ratio (IVCR)**

IVCR(A) = N_ValidatedInputs(A) / N_Inputs(A)

- N_ValidatedInputs(A): Number of input points with proper validation.

## 4. Cryptographic Architecture

**Metric: Cryptographic Strength Ratio (CSR)**

CSR(A) = N_StrongCrypto(A) / N_Crypto(A)
